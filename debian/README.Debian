emacspeak for DEBIAN
--------------------

This package was originally debianized and maintained by James R. Van
Zandt <jrv@debian.org> and all debianization stuff was stolen by me
from there and then revised. Besides that, I've included in this
package all my fixes and improvements that were grown from my own
experience of using this excellent software every day for several years.

I pretty like Emacspeak itself, but the official Debian package could
not satisfy my needs, because of lacking some extra functionality that
I've added, especially, concerning multilingual speech environment
provided by Multispeech speech server. So, I decided to make this
alternative package that is based on the latest upstream version and
includes all my additions and improvements.

In brief, the main additions are as follows:

* Improved unicode support.
* Enhanced support of several modes and packages:
  - muse package,
  - rpm frontend,
  - archive mode,
  - bbdb package,
  - dictionary frontend,
  - dired mode,
  - emms frontend,
  - mplayer frontend,
  - magit package,
  - emacs-gnus,
  - emacs-jabber.
* Provided comprehensive speech feedback for several modes and
  packages not supported in the upstream Emacspeak version:
  - debian-el package,
  - asm mode,
  - hexl mode,
  - cyclebuffer package,
  - edb database,
  - ps mode,
  - pcvs package
  - planner package,
  - emacs-wiki package,
  - emacs-w3m browser,
  - emacs wget frontend,
  - youtube-dl emacs frontend,
  - diff mode.

All original comments from James R. Van Zandt are placed below.

On the contrary to these notes, there are no alternatives to the
emacspeak startup script for various emacs flavors, but
/usr/bin/emacspeak always starts default emacs flavor with speech
support.

Also note that this package in it's present form supports only
Emacs (not Xemacs) flavors of versions 23 or higher.

The emacspeak package itself includes native info documentation and
man-pages. Some extra documentation (mainly in html form) is provided
in the separate package emacspeak-doc. Speech servers for eSpeak and
IBM ViaVoice Outloud software speech synthesizers as well as
additional sound themes are also provided in separate packages.

Emacspeak is authored by T. V. Raman <raman@cs.cornell.edu>.  These
are the primary changes made in building the Debian package: html and
plain text versions of the documentation were added.  A configuration
script (/usr/sbin/emacspeakconfig) and associated speech server
descriptions (/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/blurbs/*) were
added.  Manual pages for emacspeak and the configuration script were
added.  Minor changes are listed in changelog.Debian.

The user is expected to start emacspeak with /usr/bin/emacspeak, which
gets configuration parameters from /etc/emacspeak.conf and starts
emacs with emacspeak support.

Several "flavors" of emacs may be installed at the same time (emacs20,
emacs21, xemacs21, etc.).  In accordance with the Debian emacs policy,
emacspeak is byte-compiled separately for each supported flavor -
currently only emacs21.  There is a separate script to start each
flavor of emacs with emacspeak support - for example,
/usr/bin/emacspeak.emacs21.  /usr/bin/emacspeak is actually a symlink
managed by the "alternatives" mechanism.  That is, it points to
/etc/alternatives/emacspeak, which points to one of several links like
/usr/bin/emacspeak.emacs21.  (See the manpage for
update-alternatives.)

The alternatives for emacspeak inherit their priorities from the
corresponding emacs packages.  So, as long as the emacs and emacspeak
alternatives are in "automatic" mode, both "emacs" and "emacspeak"
will start emacs21.  If someday an emacs22 package is installed, with
priority higher than for emacs 21, then by default both "emacs" and
"emacspeak" will start emacs22.

The administrator can use update-alternatives to change which flavor
is started by either /usr/bin/emacs or /usr/bin/emacspeak.  Or, of
course, any user can use one of the flavor-specific links like
/usr/bin/emacspeak.emacs21 to start whichever flavor he wants.

Starting with version 11.0, the Emacspeak sources include a speech
server written in C++ for the IBM ViaVoice speech synthesis software.
However, it depends on the ViaVoice runtime kit which does not meet
the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  (It is available only as object
code, and only under a temporary license.)  Therefore, support for
ViaVoice is not included in this Debian package.

Starting with version 10.0, Dr. Raman has rewritten the documentation
files.  Approximately 100 commands are described there, compared to
over 800 in the documentation shipped with the previous release.
Therefore, the user should pay particular attention to the section
"Using Online Help".

Many command-line applications can be run under emacs, and can
therefore be made accessible with emacspeak.  Much of this is
explained in the documentation entitled "Running Terminal Based
Applications".  However, it is worth emphasizing this point: "For
regular shell interaction just use M-x shell instead of using the
terminal emulator."

The example file "tables.html" was supplied by Dr. Raman in a separate
email.  It may be found in /usr/share/doc/emacspeak/examples.  It includes a
sample table with three columns (labeled "item", "date", and
"amount"), and three rows.  For a discussion of the support for tables
in emacspeak and w3, see NEWS (or NEWS.gz) in /usr/share/doc/emacspeak.

The Emacspeak-HOWTO contains additional documentation.  The plain text
form of this can be found in the Debian package doc-linux, and is
installed as /usr/share/doc/HOWTO/Emacspeak-HOWTO.gz.  Other formats are
also available.  For example, these can be found at sunsite.unc.edu:

  /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/dvi/Emacspeak-HOWTO.dvi.gz
  /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/html/Emacspeak-HOWTO-html.tar.gz
  /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/ps/Emacspeak-HOWTO.ps.gz
  /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/sgml/Emacspeak-HOWTO.sgml.gz
