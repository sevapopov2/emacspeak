<p>Since the BBC's various channels are what I listen to the
most, launching BBC channels has always been a couple of
keystrokes in Emacspeak. As a first step, directory
<code>realaudio/radio</code> contains shortcut files for
launching  live streams from the various BBC channels.</p>
<p>
In addition, module <code>emacspeak-url-template</code> defines a
number of <em>Smart URLs</em> for single-click access to BBC
programs. The ones I use the most are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Smart URL</em> <code>BBC Channels On Demand</code>, and </li>
<li><em>Smart URL</em> <code>BBC Genres On Demand</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
These <em>smart URLs</em> prompt for the channel or genre
respectively and bring up a Web page that lists the various shows
that are available --- note that the BBC archives shows for a
whole week.
The resulting Web page is easy to browse in W3; the most
effective way to skim the buffer is to repeatedly hit
<code>i</code> which moves through the various items on the page.
Hitting <code>e e</code> (that's the letter <code>e</code>
<em>twice</em>) while on a hyperlink will launch the
corresponding media stream by calling   a <em>context-aware</em>
command that knows about transforming the URL to one that
accesses the program stream; --- note that simply following the
hyperlink will get you first to a page about the program, rather
than to the program stream itself.</p>
<p>To find out what channels and genres are available, browse the
BBC Web site --- channel and genre names are not hard-wired into
Emacspeak since these can change over time with channels and
genres being added or renamed.</p>
