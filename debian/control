Description: speech output interface to Emacs
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.
 .
 Emacspeak is built on
 top of Emacs.  Once Emacs is started with Emacspeak loaded, users get
 spoken feedback for all actions.  As Emacs can do everything,
 they get speech feedback for everything they do.
 .
 This package also includes speech server written in Tcl to support
 the DECtalk Express speech synthesizer and remote speech server
 access scripts.  For other synthesizers, look for separate
 speech server packages such as emacspeak-espeak, emacspeak-outloud,
 multispeech and eflite.
